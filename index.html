    <div class="content">
      <p>I was never the fastest learner nor the best at understanding school material. But I had one secret. I continually developed my examination technique.</p>
      <p>For most subjects that I had, the exams counted for over 75% of the marks. Because of this, I decided to put my focus towards examination and this paid off well with a UAI of 99+ (ATAR) and a 3.75 GPA. I also finished all my Actuarial Part III exams on my first go (each with a 80% fail rate).</p>
      <p>I have shared my techniques with hundreds of students over the years but I wanted to reach out further.</p>
      <p>I created studybot, an online quiz generator that simulates exam conditions in an fun environment. The questions are based on past examination papers as these questions are most reflective of what the future questions may be.</p>
      <p>Exam technique can be developed through repetitions in the same manner as going to the gym. Each time you go work out if you aim to beat your previous best by a small amount. Overtime this develops muscle memory and technique in order to execute.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Studybot helps students develop strong examination technique through quizes based on past examination questions.</p>
      <p>Exam technique like all other skills can be developed through training. It is essential to have good exam skills to be able to translate understanding into raw marks.</p>
